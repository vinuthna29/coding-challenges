To go through the file and count bytes, words and lines let's use bufio package.

Directly length of file would give us the byte sized but what about other ??
Lets use ReadRune so we could cover the rest by checking the characters

Some assumptions we make to move forward:
if char is \n we can assume next line
check the given rune is a space character --> inbuilt unicode ==> to get word count    CAUTION: IT IS WRONG, PS: realised later

Results time :
expected : 7145   58164  342190 test.txt
my output: 7145   67340  342190 test.txt

:(  my word count is wrong :(

check the given rune is not a space character --> see if it is inside word ?? !! ==> wordcount

7145 58164 342190 test.txt 
Hurrayyyyy !!

Ok found a better option.. hehe 
bufio Scanner can do this using splits but reader has better flexibility right !
